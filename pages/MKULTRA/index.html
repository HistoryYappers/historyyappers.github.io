        <h1> MK ULTRA </h1>
        <span style="padding-left: 5vw; padding-right: 5vw;">Project MK Ultra was an illegal program run by the Central 
            Intelligence Agency (C.I.A) to find ways to brainwash enemies of the state and force confessions using various 
            physical, psychoactive, and phycological torture methods. Over the 20 years this project was active, it was 
            the source of major human rights violations perpetrated by the United States Government.

            <span style="margin-right: calc(12px + 34vw);">Project MK ULF RA or MKULTRA was the code name for a covert CIA 
                mind-control and chemical interrogation research program, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. 
                This official US government program began in the early 1950s, continuing through the 1960s. MKULTRA 
                supposedly used United States citizens as unwitting test subjects. The published evidence indicates that 
                Project MK-ULTRA involved the secretive use of malicious drugs, as well as other methods, to 
                manipulate individual mental states and to alter brain function.

            <span style="margin-left: calc(12px + 34vw);">Project MK-ULTRA was first brought to wide public attention 
                in 1975 by the U.S. Congress, through investigations by the Church Committee, and by a presidential 
                commission known as the Rockefeller Commission. Investigative efforts were hampered by-the fact that CIA 
                Director Richard Helms ordered all MK-ULTRA tiles destroyed in I973; the Church Committee and Rockefeller 
                Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small 
                number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order.
